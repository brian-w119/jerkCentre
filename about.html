    <section class="about">
        Situated on the picturesque coast of Portland, Jamaica, the Jerk Hut offers a sense overwhelming taste of Jamaica.
        We were officially launched in 2005, and have to date catered to over 500,000 persons. Our jerk is done in the traditional way,
        on an open flame, with various wood that infuses the dishes with a scintallating aroma.
        All our ingredients are locally sourced, and we try to be as environmentally conscious as possible in our operations.
